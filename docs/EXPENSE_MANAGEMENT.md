```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Backend Setup

The expense system is already integrated into the main backend. Ensure your backend is running:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Mobile Integration

Import and use the ExpenseManagement component:

```typescript
import ExpenseManagement from './modules/ExpenseManagement';

// In your app navigation or screen
<ExpenseManagement />
```

### 3. Database Initialization

The expense models will automatically create the necessary MongoDB collections when first used.
